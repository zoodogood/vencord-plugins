Vencord plugins are somewhat unusual. When developing one of them, I had a lot
of fun. I would like to share why that is so. Since all plugins are already
included in the client at the stage of its building and plugin development is
done in the environment of this client, - we don't have to deal with the
configuration and customization of the project. Besides, using the code editor
features, such as CTRL + SHIFT + F (global search), we can see how this or that
functionality was used by other developers, - in general, it was a unique
experience
